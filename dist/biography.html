					<h2 style="color:black;">Biography</h2>
					<p class="portrait-text">So, the story goes something like: I was born in the heart of North London at a very
						early age (I only jest). I’ve been surrounded by music all my life whether it be
						blasting out of cars, on the back of buses or from my dad’s DIY music studio. I always loved being able to
						express creativity and I discovered music as a creative outlet when my father (Jazz Guitarist & Saxophonist)
						began teaching me the guitar.
						<br />
						<br />
						I was however, eventually swept away from music by the world of video games (^_^)
						But, once in secondary school, I joined the internal music specialist school through which I had to learn an
						orchestral instrument. At the ignorant age of about 12, I chose what I thought was the shiniest, easiest
						transition from the recorder (which I was learning in primary school) : the flute. I quickly discovered the
						deceptively innocent looking flute, was exceedingly distinct from the recorder and a beast in its own right.
						This simultaneously helped me re-discover my drive and love for music. I continued to study the flute for
						several years before achieving an ABRSM Grade 6.
						<br />
						<br />
						Through my love for video games, I also discovered the computing course. This initially led to a tough
						internal battle between computing and music as a career. But, at roughly age 14, I acquired a taste for rock
						and metal records and began paying particular attention to the drum kit. Consequently, I became very
						attentive when passing the drum room in school. Eventually, my curiosity bewitched me and I went inside
						after seeing someone in my year group practicing. This was my first drum lesson...and… I suddenly couldn’t
						get enough of it. I became a drum kit junkie to the point that tutors had to ask me to leave as I would
						spend hours on the kit after school.
						<br />
						<br />
						Months later, after attaining some fluency on the kit, I joined the school band and began learning rock and
						funk records, performing at school concerts and events. This led to me sitting in on my father's lower
						profile gigs. My passion and love for it began to grow faster than the mercury in a thermometer stirring a
						slush puppy. Hence, I started taking formal lessons from Neil Findlay, drummer for ‘The Curse of Lono’.
						<br />
						<br />
						In sixth form, I discovered the music technology course. This bridged the gap between my two passions and
						wholly solidified my choice of music at university. This also summoned a wormhole into a new dimension, a
						new virtue spawned from the innovatory music and technologically infused ingenious piece of software known
						as a digital audio workstation. This introduced me to production, engineering, recording, mixing and so
						on...
						<br />
						<br />
						Once at the Academy of Contemporary music, I began learning under Darren Beckett, New York jazz drummer who
						has worked with ‘The Killers’ and George Colligan. Later, I was also taught by George Cook, contemporary
						session drummer who has worked with the likes of Eminem and ‘The Japanese House’. I eventually also studied
						under Matt Hector, drummer for Iggy pop and ‘Razorlight’. These beasts, amongst others, were all big
						inspirations to my playing and each added a new dimension to my drumming. They also helped to spark deep
						interest in genres such as Jazz/ Latin, Hip Hop, Motown, Blues and much more.
						<br />
						<br />
						Concurrently, I began playing with Keny Charles in a Jazz/Funk/Soul band. Keny has worked with and supported
						the likes of George Benson and Lionel Richie. This was an important time in my development as within this
						band I worked with Derrick Mcintyre, former Jamiroquai bassist which greatly aided in improving my feel and
						musicality. Shortly after I began playing in a Jazz quartet with my dad called Jazzetude at venues across
						London such as the Jazz Cafe. A year later I joined The Days Run, an indie rock band and played on and mixed
						down 3 singles as well as toured with them across London and the UK. I met FRNDS as CMPNY around the same
						time and did some production work with them. Between this, I met Andy Metcalfe, bassist for Squeeze & ‘the
						soft boys’ who had also worked with Jools Holland. We played predominantly in a Gypsy Jazz band called ‘The
						Garcons’, across London. Throughout all this I’ve still been composing / doing production work and I always
						set aside downtime for my slightly unhealthy video game obsession.
